      Design or Co-design a Relevant Strategic Response to a Complex Problem
    </div>
    <div class="skill-content">
      <p>Designing or co-designing a strategic response to a complex problem requires a structured, user-centered, and collaborative approach. Complex problems are typically characterized by multiple stakeholders, uncertainty, evolving requirements, and interdependent factors such as technology, business constraints, and user needs.</p>
      
      <div class="skill-highlight">
        A relevant strategic response begins with <strong>problem understanding</strong>, which involves research, data analysis, and stakeholder interviews to clearly define the root causes rather than just symptoms.
      </div>
      
      <p>Co-design emphasizes <strong>collaboration between designers, developers, users, and decision-makers</strong>. This approach ensures that solutions are realistic, inclusive, and aligned with real user expectations.</p>
      
      <p>Strategic responses often use frameworks such as <strong>design thinking</strong>, <strong>systems thinking</strong>, and <strong>agile methodologies</strong> to prototype, test, and refine ideas iteratively. The final strategy should balance innovation, feasibility, scalability, and long-term sustainability while remaining adaptable to change.</p>
